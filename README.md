# Pyber Analysis
## July 22, 2022

#### **Overview**
The purpose of this project was to breakdown the average amount of fare being generated by Pyber, a rideshare company, by city type. City type was broken down into three categories: urban, suburban, and rural. Further analysis was conducted to show the total far by city type over several months. 
#### **Results**

 The table above shows the total rides, total drivers, and total fare by city. This data is further broken down into the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver. The total fare and the average fare per ride, as well as the total fare and avaerage fare per driver both showed an inverse relationship. In the rural city type, the total fare generated was the lowest, but the avarage fares per ride and driver were the highest, when compared to the other city types. At the other end, the urban city type total fare generated was the highest, but the avarage fares per ride and driver were the lowest. This could be representative of the supply and demand in each city type.

 This table shows the total fare by city ttpe over several months. Further statistical analysis over several years would need to be donw to see if there are any true trends in relation to total fare generated  and time of year. No real accurate conclusions can be made with just this data. 
#### **Summary**
Overall, the data gathered is not remarkable. The supply and demand by each city type matches the data. Three recommendations for this purpose of this homework assignement could be to try and higher more drivers in rural areas to drive down costs per ride. This may increase overall usage of the rideshare program, but it would probably not be statisticall significant. Another recommendation could be to increase the costs of rides in urban areas. The demands in this city types seem to be higher, so people may pay a higher price to use the same services. If you dont lose a significant amount of customers from increasing prices, then the total fare generated could increase. Lastly, some experimentation could be done with both lowering and raising rides costs with the suburban area, since the data is even less significant in that city type. Overall, the gathered data does not give enough information to give any recomendation. Tons of more information would need to be collected to even begin to understand the trends by city type.
